# Getting Started with Storybookjs W/ Reactjs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) --template typescript

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `yarn storybook`

Start Storybook locally . [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
